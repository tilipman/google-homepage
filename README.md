# google-homepage

This is my first The Odin Project project. I have made a google homepage clone.

This project has helped me realise how much more practice I need to internalise all the options of css, and the intuitively know how and when to use them. I still have a lot to learn. 


I have demonstrated basics of html, using id and classes in css, and use of css grid.
